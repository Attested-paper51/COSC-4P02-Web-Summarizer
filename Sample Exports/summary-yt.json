The emphasis is particularly on the last principle, telling one’s truth. The speaker shares a personal anecdote to explain this value, recounting how they grew up in a Catholic family in New Orleans where Lent was observed by giving up cherished things. The speaker recounts various items they had given up over the years, from soda to French kisses, but one year chose to give up speaking entirely, considering it the most significant sacrifice. This story is used to illustrate the importance of using one’s voice and the personal realization of its value, setting an example for their students about the importance of speaking up and sharing their truths.","option":"Timestamp","startTime":"0:1","endTime":"0:2"}
