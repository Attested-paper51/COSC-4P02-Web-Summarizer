What was your motivation?:
This project aims to address the challenges users face in accessing relevant information efficiently in the digital age. Navigating through the vast amount of information available online without efficient technologies that provide concise summaries makes information retrieval a daunting task. To simplify access to information, the proposed tool aims to generate shorter URLs for easy sharing and provide succinct and insightful content summaries while employing LLMs or NLP, thus hoping to contribute to a more streamlined and user-friendly digital experience.

What problem does it solve?: 
When looking for quick access to relevant material in the age of technology, people may find it overwhelming due to the huge amount of information available online. Long URLs are difficult to navigate, and the lack of concise summaries may make it more difficult to understand information properly. It is obvious that to improve user experience and make information retrieval simpler, a tool that can create concise summaries and shorten URLs will be required.

What is our objective?:
The objective is to create a program where the input would be a YouTube video or a webpage URL and the output would include a shorter URL for simple sharing. Additionally, the tool will make use of Large Language Models (LLMs) or Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide short and insightful summaries of web content. Both free and premium aspects of the application would be available, such as user dashboard, social media integration, API access, and custom summarization levels.
