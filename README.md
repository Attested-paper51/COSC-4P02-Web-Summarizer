<h4>What was your motivation?:</h4>
This project aims to address the challenges users face in accessing relevant information efficiently in the digital age. Navigating through the vast amount of information available online without efficient technologies that provide concise summaries makes information retrieval a daunting task. To simplify access to information, the proposed tool aims to generate shorter URLs for easy sharing and provide succinct and insightful content summaries while employing LLMs or NLP, thus hoping to contribute to a more streamlined and user-friendly digital experience.

<h4>What problem does it solve?:</h4>
When looking for quick access to relevant material in the age of technology, people may find it overwhelming due to the huge amount of information available online. Long URLs are difficult to navigate, and the lack of concise summaries may make it more difficult to understand information properly. It is obvious that to improve user experience and make information retrieval simpler, a tool that can create concise summaries and shorten URLs will be required.

<h4>What is our objective?:</h4>
The objective is to create a program where the input would be a YouTube video or a webpage URL and the output would include a shorter URL for simple sharing. Additionally, the tool will make use of Large Language Models (LLMs) or Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide short and insightful summaries of web content. Both free and premium aspects of the application would be available, such as user dashboard, social media integration, API access, and custom summarization levels.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
