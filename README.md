### Motivation

Our motivation stems from the challenges faced in efficiently accessing relevant information in the digital age. With the vast amount of information available online, technologies that can provide concise summaries and shorten URLs are essential for a streamlined digital experience.

### Problem Solved

The tool addresses the overwhelming nature of navigating through extensive information online and simplifies access to relevant material by creating concise summaries and shortening URLs for easier navigation and understanding.

### Objective

Our objective is to develop a program that inputs a YouTube video or webpage URL and outputs a shorter URL for simple sharing. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) or Natural Language Processing (NLP), the tool will also provide short and insightful summaries of web content, offering both free and premium features such as user dashboards, social media integration, API access, and custom summarization levels.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload with changes.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. More info [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for best performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, there's no going back! If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.
